# Logisim-Desktop File
![Cocoapods platforms](https://img.shields.io/badge/Plaform-linux%20%7C%20osx-green)
## For easy creation of a desktop icon for your search/Application tray 
* You just need to add the location of the logisim JAR file and its icon file(present in this repo) in the .desktop file
* Add the edited logisim.desktop file in /usr/share/appllications/ where all your .desktoo files are present
 <br></br>
*P.S I have added the PNG(512x512) file but please look at the designer's attribution by following the information from this [link](https://iconduck.com/icons/63432/logisim)*
